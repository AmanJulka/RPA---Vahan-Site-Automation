## 🚗 VAHAN Website Automation for Vehicle Loan RC Updates 🚀

###  End-to-End Automation of Registration Certificate (RC) Data Processing for Vehicle Loans 🏦 -  Streamlining PDD Closure and Enhancing Data Accuracy!

This project automated the intricate and manual process of verifying and updating Registration Certificate (RC) details for vehicle loans using the VAHAN government website and YES Bank's FinnOne system. The solution delivers end-to-end automation, streamlining Post Disbursement Document (PDD) closure, significantly reducing manual effort, enhancing data accuracy, and improving the efficiency of vehicle loan operations.

### 🎯 Requirement: Complex, Multi-System Manual Process for RC Data Verification and Update

The existing process for RC data management was highly manual, complex, and time-consuming:

*   **😓 Manual Data Extraction & Filtering:** Operations users manually extracted PDD dumps and Asset Details dumps from shared drives and filtered them for relevant loan products (ALN, CVL, CEL, TWL, UCE, UCL, UCV, MEN, PEN) and document types (RC Book, Registration Certificate, Invoice).
*   **⏱️ Time-Intensive VAHAN Website Checks:** For a significant portion of cases, users had to manually visit the VAHAN website, search for RC details using Chassis and Engine numbers, and verify the information.
*   **⚠️ Manual Data Comparison & CPU Remarks:**  Comparing data between dumps and the VAHAN website, and then manually applying complex business rules to add "CPU Remarks" in the PDD dump, was error-prone and required deep process knowledge.
*   **📝 Manual FinnOne System Updates:**  Based on VAHAN website verification, users had to manually update FinnOne's PDD module and Asset Details module with RC and registration information, involving maker-checker processes within FinnOne itself.
*   **📁 Manual RC Copy Download & Storage:** Downloading RC soft copies from VAHAN and storing them in a designated shared drive with a specific naming convention was yet another manual step.
*   **📊 Manual MIS Report Generation & Distribution:**  Creating and distributing updated VAHAN MIS reports to stakeholders was a manual compilation and dissemination task.

### 🤖 Automation Approach:  A Comprehensive, Rule-Based Automation across Systems

Our automation strategy tackled this complex process with a robust, multi-faceted RPA solution:

*   **📥 Automated Data Intake from Shared Drives:** 🤖 Bot automatically retrieves **PDD dumps and Asset_Details_new dumps** from pre-defined shared drive locations, initiating the automated workflow.
*   **🔍 Intelligent Data Filtering & Product-Specific Logic:** 🤖 Bot intelligently filters the data for **relevant loan products (ALN, CVL, CEL, TWL)** and document descriptions (RC Book, Registration Certificate, Invoice), applying product-specific processing logic.
*   **🔗 Data Enrichment & Cross-Referencing:** 🤖 Bot performs **VLOOKUP** operations to enrich the PDD dump with **Registration No, Engine No, Chassis No, and Invoice No.** from the Asset_Details_new dump, creating a consolidated dataset for processing.
*   **🧠 Complex Business Rule Engine for "CPU Remarks":** 🤖 Bot implements a sophisticated rule engine to automatically populate the **"CPU Remarks" column** in the PDD dump based on a matrix of conditions including product type, document status, and data availability (Invoice Pending, Asset Details Required, WIP, etc.), mirroring the manual decision-making process.
*   **🌐 VAHAN Website Integration for RC Data Retrieval:** 🤖 For "WIP" cases, the bot seamlessly integrates with the **VAHAN website**:
    *   **Automated Login:** 🤖 Bot logs into the VAHAN portal using provided credentials.
    *   **Intelligent Search:** 🤖 Bot automatically navigates to the "Search for RC" functionality and enters **Chassis Number and the last 5 digits of the Engine Number** from the PDD dump.
    *   **Data Extraction and Verification:** 🤖 Bot extracts RC details from the VAHAN website and **automatically compares** key fields like Customer Name, Engine Number, Chassis Number, and Hypothecation details against the PDD dump data.
*   **📝 Automated "CPU Remarks" Update Based on VAHAN Data:** 🤖 Based on the VAHAN website data comparison, the bot automatically updates the **"CPU Remarks" column** in the PDD dump with specific statuses like "Customer Name Mismatch," "Chassis and Engine Number Mismatch," "Details Not Available in VAHAN," "HP details not available," "Wrong Hypo," or prepares for FinnOne update for clean matches.
*   **🛠️ Maker-Checker Workflow for Exception Handling:** 🤖  For cases requiring manual review or validation, the bot provides a **user interface within the RPA tool with maker-checker functionality**.  Users can review VAHAN data, validate findings, and manually trigger FinnOne updates as needed, ensuring human oversight for exceptions.
*   **🔄 Automated FinnOne System Updates:** 🤖 For cases where VAHAN data verification is successful, the bot automatically performs updates in **FinnOne:**
    *   **PDD Module Update:** 🤖 Updates document status to "Received," sets Received Date, and FTR/FTNR to "FTR" for "RC Book" or "Registration Certificate" in the PDD module.
    *   **Asset Details Update:** 🤖 Updates Registration Number and Registration Date in the Asset Details Updation module.
*   **📥 Automated RC Book Download and Secure Storage:** 🤖 For successfully updated cases, the bot automatically **downloads the RC Book soft copy from the VAHAN website**, saves it as a PDF with a standardized naming convention (Agreement Number_Vahan_RC), and stores it securely in a designated shared drive location, organized by date.
*   **📤 Automated MIS Report Generation & Distribution:** 🤖 Bot automatically generates and distributes the updated **Vahan MIS report** to pre-defined stakeholders, providing timely performance and status visibility.
*   **📧 Automated Email Notifications for System Failures:** 🤖 In case of system failures or exceptions, the bot generates **self-explanatory error reports and notifications** to designated users, enabling swift issue resolution.
*   **🔒 Comprehensive Audit Trails & Archival:** 🤖 The solution includes robust **audit trails** logging every bot action and user interaction, and defines **data archival policies** for long-term data management and compliance.

### ✨ Role of Automation:  From Manual Chaos to Automated Precision and Control

Automation fundamentally transformed the VAHAN data processing workflow, delivering unprecedented efficiency and control:

*   **End-to-End Automation of a Complex Process:** 🤖 Bot automates the entire lifecycle of RC data processing, from data extraction and VAHAN website interaction to FinnOne updates and reporting, eliminating almost all manual touchpoints.
